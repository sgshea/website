Demo application created using a technology stack centered around [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) for both the back and frontend.

Features include a frontend using [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org/) and [Reagent](https://reagent-project.github.io/), and a backend API server with an SQLite database.
