Implementation of [Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT)](https://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf) in Rust.

NEAT is a genetic algorithm for the generation of evolving artificial neural networks. Evolution is accomplished by
altering both weights and structure of the networks.
