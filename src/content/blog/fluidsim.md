Eulerian fluid simulator written in Rust ontop of the Bevy engine.

The code is based upon the [Matthias MÃ¼ller's 10 Minute Physics demo](https://matthias-research.github.io/pages/tenMinutePhysics/index.html). 

Writing the simulator in Rust allows for running the simulator as a native application, as well as the ability to [run on the web](https://sgshea.github.io/fluid-rs/) by compiling to webassembly. Using webassembly allows the application to perform better than the original JavaScript demo.
