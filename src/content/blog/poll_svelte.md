A poll voting and creation application created using Sveltekit and Supabase.

Built using Svelte 5 on the frontend and using TailwindCSS. The backend is powered by Sveltekit and uses Supabase for database operations.

Using the Supabase realtime features, we can create polls in real time without needing to refresh the page. Users can vote on a poll and see results as they come in.
